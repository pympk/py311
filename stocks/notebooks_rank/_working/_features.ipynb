    "### **Category 1: Trend & Quality Features**\n",
    "*(Calculated over `lookback_days`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**`close_slope`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** The direction and steepness of the **closing price** trend. This is your primary trend indicator.\n",
    "    *   Positive value = Uptrend\n",
    "    *   Negative value = Downtrend\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To find stocks that are in a general uptrend.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    {'column': 'close_slope', 'operator': '>', 'value': 0.001}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`close_r_squared`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** The \"quality\" or \"steadiness\" of the closing price trend. It tells you how linear the trend is.\n",
    "    *   Value close to `1.0` = A smooth, predictable, straight-line trend.\n",
    "    *   Value close to `0.0` = A choppy, noisy, unreliable trend.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To filter for high-quality trends and avoid random noise.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    {'column': 'close_r_squared', 'operator': '>', 'value': 0.5}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`volume_slope`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** The trend of the trading volume. It shows if interest in the stock is generally increasing or decreasing.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To find stocks where an uptrend is supported by increasing trading volume (a sign of strength).\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    {'column': 'volume_slope', 'operator': '>', 'value': 0.005}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Other Slope & R-Squared Features)**\n",
    "*   `open_slope`, `high_slope`, `low_slope` work just like `close_slope` but for the open, high, and low prices.\n",
    "*   `open_r_squared`, `high_r_squared`, `low_r_squared` work just like `close_r_squared` for their respective prices.\n",

    "### **Category 2: Volatility & Risk Features**\n",
    "*(Calculated over `lookback_days`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**`close_penalty_score`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** A powerful composite risk score. It combines trend quality (`r_squared`) and price volatility (`std_dev`). **A lower score is better.**\n",
    "    *   Low Score = The stock is stable and has a smooth, high-quality trend.\n",
    "    *   High Score = The stock is volatile and has a choppy, low-quality trend.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To strongly filter for \"well-behaved\" stocks and avoid unpredictable, risky ones.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    {'column': 'close_penalty_score', 'operator': '<', 'value': 0.015}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`unified_std_dev_returns`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** The typical daily price volatility or \"choppiness\" of a stock.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To specifically target low-volatility stocks for stable strategies or high-volatility stocks for aggressive strategies.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Example: Find stable, low-volatility stocks\n",
    "    {'column': 'unified_std_dev_returns', 'operator': '<', 'value': 0.03}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Other Penalty Scores)**\n",
    "*   `open_penalty_score`, `high_penalty_score`, `low_penalty_score`, and `volume_penalty_score` work the same way for their respective data points. A low score is always desirable for quality.\n",

    "### **Category 3: Mean-Reversion / Momentum Features (Z-Scores)**\n",
    "*(Calculated over `rolling_window`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**`z_score_Adj Close`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** How far the current closing price has deviated from its recent average (measured in standard deviations). It tells you if a stock is \"oversold\" or \"overbought\" in the short term.\n",
    "    *   **Large Negative Value (e.g., < -2.0):** The price has dropped significantly and is \"oversold.\" This is a **mean-reversion** (buy the dip) signal.\n",
    "    *   **Large Positive Value (e.g., > 2.0):** The price has risen significantly and is \"overbought.\" This is a **momentum** (breakout) signal.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Example: Find \"oversold\" stocks for a buy-the-dip strategy\n",
    "    {'column': 'z_score_Adj Close', 'operator': '<', 'value': -2.0}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**`z_score_Volume`**\n",
    "*   **What it Measures:** How much the current day's volume has deviated from its recent average volume.\n",
    "*   **How to Use it in a Strategy:** To find stocks experiencing a massive, unusual surge in trading activity, which often confirms a price move or signals a major event.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Example: Find stocks with a huge volume spike (more than 3 standard deviations above average)\n",
    "    {'column': 'z_score_Volume', 'operator': '>', 'value': 3.0}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Other Z-Scores)**\n",
    "*   `z_score_Adj Open`, `z_score_Adj High`, `z_score_Adj Low` work the same way, telling you if the open, high, or low prices are statistically unusual compared to their recent past."
