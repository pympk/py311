    Executes a given Jupyter notebook using nbconvert and saves the output.

    This function handles the complexities of calling a command-line tool from Python,
    including path management, error capturing, and setting the correct working directory.

        notebook_path (Path): A pathlib.Path object pointing to the notebook to be executed.
