    "**The \"Vertical Velocity\" (Pure Growth)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The raw percentage change in price over the lookback window ($N$):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Price Gain} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{Price}_{t-N}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock has delivered the highest absolute capital appreciation. It ignores \"how\" it got there (volatility) and focuses only on the \"where.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is stagnant or in a downtrend.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Trend Chaser\":** In strong bull markets, the Agent may pivot to raw Gain to capture the \"hottest\" runners where volatility is secondary to momentum.\n",
    "    *   **Baseline:** It serves as the simplest performance benchmark against which risk-adjusted metrics are compared.\n",

    "### 2. Sharpe (Standard)\n",
    "**The \"Institutional Standard\" (Volatility-Adjusted Return)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The ratio of mean daily returns to the standard deviation of those returns (annualized):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Sharpe} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)}{\\text{Std}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)} \\times \\sqrt{252}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock provides a \"smooth\" ride. It earns its returns with low variance, suggesting a stable, predictable uptrend.\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The returns are \"noisy.\" Even if the gain is high, the high standard deviation suggests a chaotic price path that is prone to sharp reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Portfolio Stabilizer\":** The Agent selects high Sharpe stocks when the Macro VIX signals suggest a regime of rising uncertainty, favoring stability over raw speed.\n",

    "**The \"Regime Efficiency\" Ratio (Volatility-Normalized Performance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    Unlike the standard Sharpe (which uses realized standard deviation), this uses the **ATRP** (Average True Range Percent) to normalize returns by the stock's current volatility \"personality\":\n",
    "    $$\\text{ATRP} = \\frac{\\text{ATR}(14)}{\\text{Price}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock is outperforming its \"typical\" daily volatility. It is effectively \"quietly outperforming.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is moving, but the moves are small compared to its high cost of carry (volatility).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Smart Beta\" Selection:** The Agent uses this to find stocks that are \"punching above their weight class\" without the wild swings associated with high-beta names.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sharpe (TRP)\n",
    "**The \"Daily Stress Test\" Ratio (Event-Sensitive Performance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    Unlike ATRP which uses a smoothed 14-day average, TRP uses the **raw daily True Range Percent** — the single-day volatility \"shock\" without any smoothing:\n",
    "    $$\\text{True Range} = \\max\\left(\\text{High} - \\text{Low}, \\ |\\text{High} - \\text{Prev Close}|, \\ |\\text{Low} - \\text{Prev Close}|\\right)$$\n",

    "    $$\\text{Sharpe(TRP)} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)}{\\text{Mean}(\\text{TRP}, N)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock is delivering returns while keeping its *worst single-day* volatility contained. It shows resilience against gap-downs and intraday shocks.\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock may have \"quiet\" average days but suffers from occasional extreme moves (gaps, flash crashes) that the average return doesn't compensate for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Crash Avoidance\" Screening:** The Agent uses TRP to filter out names that appear stable on average (low ATRP) but have hidden tail risk — large single-day moves that can stop out positions or trigger risk limits. TRP captures the \"what's the worst that can happen tomorrow\" metric that ATRP smooths away.\n",

    "| **TRP** | None (daily) | Risk management, event detection | Single-day shocks, gap risk, tail events |\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use TRP:** When you care about *overnight risk* and *maximum adverse excursion* more than average behavior — e.g., before earnings, during high macro uncertainty, or when position sizing must account for worst-case single-day loss.  \n",

    "    The 21-trading day (one month) rate of change:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Mom\\_21} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{Price}_{t-21}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** Strong recent capital inflow. The stock is \"in play.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** Negative momentum; the stock is being distribution-sold or ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Kickoff\":** Momentum is often the first signal of a regime shift. The Agent uses this to identify the start of a \"breakout\" before it shows up in longer-term Sharpe metrics.\n",

    "### 5. Information Ratio (IR)\n",
    "**The \"Alpha Specialist\" (Consistency vs. Benchmark)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The ratio of **Active Return** (Stock Ret - Market Ret) to the **Tracking Error** (Std Dev of Active Returns):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Active Ret} = R_{\\text{stock}} - R_{\\text{benchmark}}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{IR} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Active Ret}, 63)}{\\text{Std}(\\text{Active Ret}, 63)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock consistently beats the market with very little \"wavering.\" It is a reliable alpha generator.\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is either underperforming or its outperformance is erratic and unpredictable compared to the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Hedge Fund Move\":** In sideways markets, the Agent uses IR to find stocks that can decouple from the index and provide idiosyncratic gains.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Consistency (Win Rate)\n",
    "**The \"Reliability Metric\" (Frequency of Green Days)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The percentage of positive-return days over the last 10 trading days:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Consistency} = \\frac{\\text{Count}(R_{daily} > 0)}{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Value of 0.8:** The stock has closed \"green\" 8 out of the last 10 days. \n",
    "    *   **High Value:** Indicates a \"relentless\" bid. This often precedes a parabolic move as shorts are squeezed and buyers FOMO in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Stealth Bid Detector\":** Even if daily returns are small, high consistency tells the Agent that a \"strong hand\" is accumulating the stock daily.\n",

    "### 7. Oversold (RSI)\n",
    "**The \"Elastic Snap\" (Mean Reversion)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The Relative Strength Index (standard 14-day), sorted in reverse (lower RSI ranks higher):\n",
    "    $$RS = \\frac{\\text{Avg Gain}}{\\text{Avg Loss}}$$\n",
    "    $$RSI = 100 - \\left(\\frac{100}{1 + RS}\\right)$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Rank Score} = -RSI$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank (Low RSI):** The stock is \"Oversold\" (e.g., RSI < 30). The price has been beaten down too fast, stretching the \"rubber band.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank (High RSI):** The stock is \"Overbought.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Contrarian\":** When the Agent detects a \"Macro Panic\" (High VIX), it may switch to RSI to buy the \"blood in the streets,\" betting on a mean-reversion bounce.\n",

    "**The \"Value Trap or Bargain\" Finder**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The distance from the 21-day high, sorted in reverse (smaller/more negative drawdown ranks higher):\n",
    "    $$\\text{DD} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{MaxPrice}(21)} - 1$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Rank Score} = -DD$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank:** The stock is significantly off its recent highs (a deep \"Dip\").\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank:** The stock is trading at or near its 21-day high (no dip).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Buy the Dip\":** The Agent uses this metric during bull market pullbacks. It identifies stocks that are historically strong but are currently \"on sale\" relative to their recent peak.\n",

    "### 9. Low Volatility\n",
    "**The \"Safety First\" Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The negative of the ATRP (Average True Range Percent):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Score} = -\\left(\\frac{ATR(14)}{\\text{Price}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank:** The stock has very small daily price swings relative to its price (e.g., a \"boring\" utility or consumer staple).\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank:** The stock is a \"mover\"—high volatility, large daily percentage swings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Capital Preservation\":** During high-risk macro regimes (VIX Backwardation), the Agent uses this to hide in the \"quietest\" stocks in the universe, minimizing the risk of a \"flash crash\" hit.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Market Regime (200d MA Deviation)\n",
    "**The \"Trend Guardian\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The percentage distance of the benchmark price from its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Regime} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Price}_{\\text{Benchmark}}}{\\text{SMA}_{200}(\\text{Price}_{\\text{Benchmark}})} \\right) - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Positive (> 0%):** The market is in a long-term uptrend (Bull Regime). Shaded green in the plot, this represents a \"healthy\" environment where momentum strategies usually thrive.\n",
    "    *   **Negative (< 0%):** The market is in a long-term downtrend (Bear Regime). Trading below the 200d MA is a primary indicator of systemic risk and potential \"tail-risk\" events.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Environmental Context\":** This is the master \"On/Off\" switch for risk. If this value is negative, the Agent may shift its internal reward function to favor cash or defensive assets, as the statistical probability of \"buy-the-dip\" success drops significantly when the long-term trend is broken.\n",

    "**The \"Acceleration Gauge\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The 21-day change (velocity) in the Market Regime, standardized by its 3-month (63-day) rolling volatility:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Velocity} = \\text{Regime}_{t} - \\text{Regime}_{t-21}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Z-Score} = \\frac{\\text{Velocity}}{\\sigma_{63}(\\text{Regime})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Accel (Red Dash @ +2.0):** The market is \"overheating.\" Price is moving higher much faster than its recent volatility profile suggests, often signaling a \"blow-off top.\"\n",
    "    *   **Decel (Green Dash @ -2.0):** The trend is rapidly losing steam or rolling over. Even in a bull market, a deep negative Z-score indicates the \"brakes\" are being slammed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Inflection Point Detection\":** The Agent uses this to distinguish between a healthy pullback and a rapid trend reversal. A high \"Accel\" reading might trigger the Agent to tighten stop-losses, while a move into \"Decel\" serves as an early warning to exit momentum trades before the 200d MA is even breached.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Fear (Red Dash @ +2.0):** Panic state. VIX is spiking far above its recent norm, typically coinciding with sharp price corrections and \"forced selling\" by institutions.\n",
    "    *   **Calm (Green Dash @ -1.5):** Complacency. Volatility is unusually suppressed, which often occurs during long \"melt-up\" phases but can precede a sudden volatility \"shock.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Contrarian Timing & Protection\":** While high \"Fear\" signals danger, it also identifies potential \"climax bottoms.\" The Agent looks for VIX Z-score spikes to identify when the \"blood is in the streets\" (a buying opportunity). Conversely, prolonged \"Calm\" may signal the Agent to rotate into \"Low Volatility\" stocks to protect against a volatility mean-reversion.\n",

    "*   **Logic:**\n",
    "    This hybrid plot standardizes market fear intensity (The Line) against the underlying \"Term Structure\" of volatility (The Background). It measures not just *how much* the market is panicking, but the *urgency* of that panic by comparing current expectations against future hedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formulas:**\n",
    "    1. **Intensity (VIX Z-Score):** Measures how extreme current volatility is relative to its own recent 3-month (63-day) behavior.\n",
    "       $$\\text{VIX Z} = \\frac{\\text{VIX}_t - \\text{SMA}_{63}(\\text{VIX})}{\\sigma_{63}(\\text{VIX})}$$\n",
    "    2. **Stability (VIX Ratio):** Measures the \"Term Structure\" by comparing the 30-day VIX against the 90-day VIX3M. This determines if the market is in a healthy \"Contango\" or a crisis \"Backwardation.\"\n",
    "       $$\\text{VIX Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{VIX}}{\\text{VIX3M}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The 3 Colored Regimes:**\n",
    "    *   🟢 **Green (STABILITY / Ratio < 0.9):** **Institutional Calm.** Current fear is significantly lower than future expectations (Deep Contango). This indicates a healthy, \"Risk-On\" environment where institutions are comfortable selling volatility.\n",
    "    *   ⚪ **Grey (TRANSITION / Ratio 0.9 - 1.0):** **Structural Shift.** The gap between current and future fear is closing. This \"flattening\" of the term structure often precedes market distribution or a high-volatility regime shift.\n",
    "    *   🔴 **Red (SYSTEMIC SHOCK / Ratio > 1.0):** **Backwardation.** Current panic exceeds future expectations. This structural inversion indicates an immediate liquidity crisis or crash event; \"buying the dip\" is statistically dangerous until the ratio resets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **Dynamic Title Monitoring:** The Agent monitors the **Dynamic Status Header** and **VIX Ratio Value** to adjust its feature weights. It favors **Mom_21 (Momentum)** in the Green zone but rotates toward **Low Volatility (ATRP)** or **Cash** as the map turns Grey.\n",
    "    *   **The \"Emergency Brake\":** If the background turns **Red (Ratio > 1.0)** and the purple line spikes, the Agent recognizes a systemic event. It overrides individual ticker \"Buy\" signals to prioritize capital preservation (SHV/BIL) until the structural inversion clears and the background returns to Grey or Green."
