    "    *   **Where:** In Section E, at the start of `def plot_walk_forward_analyzer`.\n",

    "1.  **Verify Ranking:** You now have `debug_container[0]['full_universe_ranking']`. You can sort this in Excel to prove ASTS was truly #1.\n",
    "2.  **Verify Group Gain:** You now have `debug_container[0]['portfolio_raw_components']['prices']`. You can use standard `= (Final/Initial)-1` formulas on ASTS's raw price to see if it matches the \"Group Gain\" of `+0.3660`.\n",
    "3.  **Verify Sharpe (ATR):** You now have the daily ATRP series for both the Group and the Benchmark across all three periods (`full_atrp`, `lookback_atrp`, `holding_atrp`). You can now perform the Excel calculation: `AVERAGE(Returns) / AVERAGE(ATRP)` and finally confirm that `+10.3793` figure.\n",
    "4.  **Verify Benchmark:** You now have the `benchmark_raw_components`. You can verify why the Benchmark Sharpe (ATR) is `+6.3266` by calculating the Benchmark's own volatility-normalized returns."
