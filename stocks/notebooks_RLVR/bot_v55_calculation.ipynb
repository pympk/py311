    "### 1. Price Gain\n",
    "**The \"Vertical Velocity\" (Pure Growth)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The raw percentage change in price over the lookback window ($N$):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Price Gain} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{Price}_{t-N}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock has delivered the highest absolute capital appreciation. It ignores \"how\" it got there (volatility) and focuses only on the \"where.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is stagnant or in a downtrend.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Trend Chaser\":** In strong bull markets, the Agent may pivot to raw Gain to capture the \"hottest\" runners where volatility is secondary to momentum.\n",
    "    *   **Baseline:** It serves as the simplest performance benchmark against which risk-adjusted metrics are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sharpe (Standard)\n",
    "**The \"Institutional Standard\" (Volatility-Adjusted Return)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The ratio of mean daily returns to the standard deviation of those returns (annualized):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Sharpe} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)}{\\text{Std}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)} \\times \\sqrt{252}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock provides a \"smooth\" ride. It earns its returns with low variance, suggesting a stable, predictable uptrend.\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The returns are \"noisy.\" Even if the gain is high, the high standard deviation suggests a chaotic price path that is prone to sharp reversals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Portfolio Stabilizer\":** The Agent selects high Sharpe stocks when the Macro VIX signals suggest a regime of rising uncertainty, favoring stability over raw speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sharpe (ATRP)\n",
    "**The \"Regime Efficiency\" Ratio (Volatility-Normalized Performance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    Unlike the standard Sharpe (which uses realized standard deviation), this uses the **ATRP** (Average True Range Percent) to normalize returns by the stock's current volatility \"personality\":\n",
    "    $$\\text{ATRP} = \\frac{\\text{ATR}(14)}{\\text{Price}}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Sharpe(ATRP)} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Daily Returns}, N)}{\\text{Mean}(\\text{ATRP}, N)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock is outperforming its \"typical\" daily volatility. It is effectively \"quietly outperforming.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is moving, but the moves are small compared to its high cost of carry (volatility).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Smart Beta\" Selection:** The Agent uses this to find stocks that are \"punching above their weight class\" without the wild swings associated with high-beta names.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Momentum (21d)\n",
    "**The \"Velocity Vector\" (Medium-Term Strength)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The 21-trading day (one month) rate of change:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Mom\\_21} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{Price}_{t-21}} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** Strong recent capital inflow. The stock is \"in play.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** Negative momentum; the stock is being distribution-sold or ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Kickoff\":** Momentum is often the first signal of a regime shift. The Agent uses this to identify the start of a \"breakout\" before it shows up in longer-term Sharpe metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Information Ratio (IR)\n",
    "**The \"Alpha Specialist\" (Consistency vs. Benchmark)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The ratio of **Active Return** (Stock Ret - Market Ret) to the **Tracking Error** (Std Dev of Active Returns):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Active Ret} = R_{\\text{stock}} - R_{\\text{benchmark}}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{IR} = \\frac{\\text{Mean}(\\text{Active Ret}, 63)}{\\text{Std}(\\text{Active Ret}, 63)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Value:** The stock consistently beats the market with very little \"wavering.\" It is a reliable alpha generator.\n",
    "    *   **Low Value:** The stock is either underperforming or its outperformance is erratic and unpredictable compared to the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Hedge Fund Move\":** In sideways markets, the Agent uses IR to find stocks that can decouple from the index and provide idiosyncratic gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Consistency (Win Rate)\n",
    "**The \"Reliability Metric\" (Frequency of Green Days)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The percentage of positive-return days over the last 10 trading days:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Consistency} = \\frac{\\text{Count}(R_{daily} > 0)}{10}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **Value of 0.8:** The stock has closed \"green\" 8 out of the last 10 days. \n",
    "    *   **High Value:** Indicates a \"relentless\" bid. This often precedes a parabolic move as shorts are squeezed and buyers FOMO in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Stealth Bid Detector\":** Even if daily returns are small, high consistency tells the Agent that a \"strong hand\" is accumulating the stock daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Oversold (RSI)\n",
    "**The \"Elastic Snap\" (Mean Reversion)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The Relative Strength Index (standard 14-day), sorted in reverse (lower RSI ranks higher):\n",
    "    $$RS = \\frac{\\text{Avg Gain}}{\\text{Avg Loss}}$$\n",
    "    $$RSI = 100 - \\left(\\frac{100}{1 + RS}\\right)$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Rank Score} = -RSI$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank (Low RSI):** The stock is \"Oversold\" (e.g., RSI < 30). The price has been beaten down too fast, stretching the \"rubber band.\"\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank (High RSI):** The stock is \"Overbought.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"The Contrarian\":** When the Agent detects a \"Macro Panic\" (High VIX), it may switch to RSI to buy the \"blood in the streets,\" betting on a mean-reversion bounce.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Dip Buyer (Drawdown)\n",
    "**The \"Value Trap or Bargain\" Finder**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The distance from the 21-day high, sorted in reverse (smaller/more negative drawdown ranks higher):\n",
    "    $$\\text{DD} = \\frac{\\text{Price}_{t}}{\\text{MaxPrice}(21)} - 1$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Rank Score} = -DD$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank:** The stock is significantly off its recent highs (a deep \"Dip\").\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank:** The stock is trading at or near its 21-day high (no dip).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Buy the Dip\":** The Agent uses this metric during bull market pullbacks. It identifies stocks that are historically strong but are currently \"on sale\" relative to their recent peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Low Volatility\n",
    "**The \"Safety First\" Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:**\n",
    "    The negative of the ATRP (Average True Range Percent):\n",
    "    $$\\text{Score} = -\\left(\\frac{ATR(14)}{\\text{Price}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    *   **High Rank:** The stock has very small daily price swings relative to its price (e.g., a \"boring\" utility or consumer staple).\n",
    "    *   **Low Rank:** The stock is a \"mover\"—high volatility, large daily percentage swings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **How the RL Agent Uses It:**\n",
    "    *   **\"Capital Preservation\":** During high-risk macro regimes (VIX Backwardation), the Agent uses this to hide in the \"quietest\" stocks in the universe, minimizing the risk of a \"flash crash\" hit."
