    "Looking at this registry with a quant lens, the list is **comprehensive but bloated**—we have **momentum measured five times under different names** (roc₁, roc₃, roc₅, roc₁₀, roc₂₁ and their negative twins “Pullback”).  \n",

    "2. **Risk-adjusted intraday strength**: no **Sharpe(on-balance volume)** or **volume-momentum efficiency**; OBV_Score is raw, not risk-scaled.  \n",
    "3. **Benchmark-relative consistency**: “Alpha (RelStrength)” is cumulative; add **rolling information ratio vs SPY** to catch *sustained* alpha, not one gap.  \n",
    "4. **Tail flag**: no **skew** or **max-drawdown** metric; a single 20 % gap stock can poison the book.  \n",
