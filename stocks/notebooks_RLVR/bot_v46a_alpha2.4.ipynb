    "    *   **Where:** Right before Section B (Metric Registry).\n",
    "    *   **What:** We will insert the \"Source of Truth\" dictionary here with all your descriptive comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The \"Heart\" (Engine Input):**\n",
    "    *   **Where:** In Section C, inside the `@dataclass class EngineInput`.\n",
    "    *   **What:** We will change the `default_factory` to point to the Head. This ensures the engine always knows the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The \"Face\" (The UI Function):**\n",
    "    *   **Where:** In Section E, at the start of `def plot_walk_forward_analyzer`.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this is better than a full code dump:\n",
    "*   **You learn \"DRY\" Principles:** You'll see how to avoid \"Repeating Yourself\" (DRY) by using a single variable in multiple places.\n",
    "*   **You see the \"Mapping\":** You will understand how a variable defined at the top of a script flows down into a class, and finally into a visual widget.\n",
