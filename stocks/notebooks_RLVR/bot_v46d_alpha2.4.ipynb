    "    *   **Where:** Right before Section B (Metric Registry).\n",

    "2.  **The \"Heart\" (Engine Input):**\n",

    "    *   **Where:** In Section E, at the start of `def plot_walk_forward_analyzer`.\n",

    "*   **You see the \"Mapping\":** You will understand how a variable defined at the top of a script flows down into a class, and finally into a visual widget.\n",

    "### Why this is a \"Pure\" Audit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Manual Portfolio Re-construction:** It doesn't trust the engine's `portfolio_series`. It loads the raw `prices` for RPRX and SGOV and manually normalizes them and sums them with `init_w = 0.5`. If the weights in the engine were wrong, this script would catch it.\n",
    "2.  **Standard Pandas Logic:** It uses `.pct_change()`, `.mean()`, and `.std()` directly. This proves that the results in your image aren't \"magic numbers\" from a proprietary formula—they are standard financial stats.\n",
    "3.  **Cross-Check on Sharpe (ATR):** It implements the `Sharpe (ATR)` logic using the exact rule we discussed: the numerator is the mean of returns (skipping the first NaN), and the denominator is the mean of all ATRP observations (including the first day).\n",
    "4.  **Independent Period Slicing:** It uses the `Metadata.csv` to determine the boundaries for Full, Lookback, and Holding periods, ensuring it is testing the exact same windows as the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use:\n",
    "1.  Save this script as `auditor.py` in the same directory where your Audit folder is located.\n",
    "2.  Run it using `python auditor.py`.\n",
    "3.  Compare the terminal output table to your screenshot image. They should match to the 4th decimal place."
