    "Quants treat **Sharpe(ATRP)**—return-per-unit-of-smoothed-vol—as a *slow-moving regime thermometer*, not a touch-off trigger.  Typical workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Universe pre-filter (weekly rebalance)**  \n",
    "   - Rank all liquid names by Sharpe(ATRP) using 60- to 120-day mean return ÷ 14-day Wilder ATRP.  \n",
    "   - Keep only the top *k* deciles (or z-score > 0.5).  \n",
    "   *Goal*: discard stocks that are “cheap for a reason”—i.e. high realised return but even higher *sustained* volatility; keeps the ones whose vol has stayed *quiet* while price has drifted up.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regime bucketing**  \n",
    "   - Break the history of Sharpe(ATRP) into quintiles.  \n",
    "   - When a ticker *crosses* from Q3 → Q4/Q5 for **four consecutive weeks**, tag it “vol-adjusted momentum”.  \n",
    "   - Reverse crossing (Q4 → Q2) flags *vol-expansion-without-return* → avoid or go flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Position sizing**  \n",
    "   - Target vol of portfolio (e.g. 8 % ann.).  \n",
    "   - Use **inverse of current ATRP** as the *volatility scalar*; because ATRP is already smoothed, position changes are *gradual*—no whipsaw on one-day gap.  \n",
    "   - Sharpe(ATRP) enters as a *multiplier*:  \n",
    "     `size_i ∝ (Sharpe(ATRP)_i – floor) / Σ(…)`  \n",
    "     so only positive-regime names get full risk budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stress / overlay**  \n",
    "   - When **median Sharpe(ATRP)** of the whole universe drops below zero for **>20 trading days**, book reduces gross exposure (e.g. from 100 % to 60 %).  \n",
    "   - This caught Feb-2018, Sep-2020, Jan-2022 vol explosions in many prop models because the *smoothed* ratio turned *before* 30-day realised vol exploded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Option world**  \n",
    "   - Vol-arb desks go **long gamma** on names whose *recent* Sharpe(ATRP) has **fallen** two deciles (return flat, vol quiet = cheap options).  \n",
    "   - **Short gamma** on names whose Sharpe(ATRP) has **risen** two deciles (return strong but vol now too sleepy → expect vol sellers to be over-positioned).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Futures / asset allocation**  \n",
    "   - Compute Sharpe(ATRP) for equity index, bond futures, gold, etc.  \n",
    "   - Feed into **risk-parity or momentum overlay**: increase weight to asset whose Sharpe(ATRP) > 1-yr median and *trending up* for 40 days; decrease if below median and falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway: because the metric moves **slowly**, quents use it to **tilt, scale, or gate**—not to time exact entry/exit.  It answers “*should I be there at all?*” and “*how much risk once I am?*” rather than “*do I buy tomorrow’s open?*”"

    "    *   *Result:* Even though today was quiet ($1), the ATR stays very high ($1.93). **It remembers the crash from yesterday.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Day 15 (Two Weeks Later):**\n",
    "    *   **If we used SMA:** The $15 crash falls out of the window. The SMA drops instantly back to 1.0. The system \"forgets\" the risk.\n",
    "    *   **Using Wilder's:** That $15 crash is still mathematically present, just diluted. The ATR might still be $1.20, telling the RL Agent: *\"Be careful, this stock has a history of violence.\"*\n",

    "**Why this matters for your Code:**\n",
    "By using `ewm(alpha=1/period, adjust=False)` in your code, you enabled this \"infinite memory.\" This prevents your RL agent from getting blindsided by a stock that looks calm today but exploded three weeks ago."
